            <p>Our Story starts in class 10. I don't have a Smartphone at that time.so, I massaged her with my fathers Smartphone. we started a conversation. we passed our SSC.So she decided to admit to GIMC.so I applied 2nd time for GIMC and I got a chance. Then I proposed to her on 05 October (11:05). Our relationship was going so well. we were the happiest couple. many people can't tolerate that. they tried to break up with us. I make some mistakes and she left meðŸ˜… but I have hope that she will understand me and will back to prove no one can break a real love. <span> In Sah Allah </span> We Will be together from todayâœ¨.</p>
